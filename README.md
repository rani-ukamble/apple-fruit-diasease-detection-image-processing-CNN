# Apple-fruit-diasease-detection-image-processing-CNN

Goal: The major reason affecting apple production is the occurrence of apple diseases. In order to improve the fruit production of the valley, it is necessary to detect the onset of diseases on time and accordingly advise the farmers to act based on the expert suggestions and recommendations.

Smart Fruit Disease Detection and Recommendation System is an intelligent system (app-based) that uses state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for automatic detection of various diseases from fruits, leaves, tree trunks, etc. Post detection, the smart recommendation system shall provide the farmer with the best expert opinion and suggestions to deal with the detected diseases. Moreover, important data (fruit type, detected disease, severity, location, weather info etc.) shall be sent to the cloud for further analysis which shall help in disease forecasting in the future.

Convolution: Convolution is performed on an image to identify certain features in an image. Convolution helps in blurring, sharpening, edge detection, noise reduction and more on an image that can help the machine to learn specific characteristics of an image.

Pooling: A convoluted image can be too large and therefore needs to be reduced. Pooling is mainly done to reduce the image without losing features or patterns.

Flattening: Flattening transforms a two-dimensional matrix of features into a vector of features that can be fed into a neural network or classifier.

Full-Connection: Full connection simply refers to the process of feeding the flattened image into a neural network.
